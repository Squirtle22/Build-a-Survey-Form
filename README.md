# Survey Form Project

## Overview

This project is a part of a FreeCodeCamp challenge to build a survey form. The goal is to create a form that is functionally similar to the provided demo but unique in design and implementation. The form will collect user inputs through various types of fields.

## Objective

Build a survey form following the user stories as listed in the project instructions. Ensure the form is aesthetically pleasing and functionally robust.

## User Stories

- **Title and Description:**
  - The page should have an `h1` element with an `id` of `title`.
  - Include a short explanation in a `p` element with an `id` of `description`.

- **Form Requirements:**
  - The main form should have an `id` of `survey-form`.
  - Include fields for name, email, and number with corresponding labels and placeholders.
  - Implement input validation for email and number fields.
  - Add a select dropdown, radio buttons, checkboxes, a textarea, and a submit button as detailed in the project guidelines.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal and run: `git clone https://github.com/Squirtle22/survey-form.git`
   - Navigate into the project directory: `cd survey-form`

2. **Open the Project:**
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - In VS Code, go to File > Open Folder, and select the `survey-form` directory.

3. **Install Extensions (Optional):**
   - It is recommended to install the `Live Server` extension in VS Code to preview your project.

4. **Development:**
   - Make changes to `index.html` and `styles.css` as needed to fulfill the project requirements.
   - Test your form locally using the `Live Server` extension.

5. **Push Changes:**
   - After making changes, push them to your GitHub repository.
   - Use `git add .`, `git commit -m "your commit message"`, and `git push origin main`.

6. **Copy to FreeCodeCamp:**
   - Once your project is complete and functional, copy your HTML and CSS to the FreeCodeCamp project submission page.

## Testing

- Ensure that all user stories are implemented and pass all the tests specified by FreeCodeCamp.

## Deployment

- The project can be hosted using GitHub Pages or any other static site hosting service.
